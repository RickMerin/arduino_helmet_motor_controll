# Helmet Detection and Motor Control System

## Overview

This project ensures a vehicle's motor only runs when the rider is wearing a helmet. An ultrasonic sensor detects helmet presence, and an nRF24L01 transceiver module handles wireless communication between the helmet (transmitter) and the vehicle (receiver). If the helmet is not worn or is too far away, the motor will not run.

## System Operation

1. **Transmitter (Helmet):**  
   - The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the riderâ€™s head.  
   - If the distance is less than 10 cm, it signals the receiver that the helmet is worn.  

2. **Receiver (Vehicle):**  
   - The receiver checks the transmitted data.  
   - If the helmet is worn (distance < 10 cm), the motor runs. Otherwise, it remains off.

## Notes
- Ensure proper power connections for the nRF24L01 modules.
- Adjust the helmet detection threshold (default: 10 cm) based on design requirements.
- Use an adequate external power source for the motor driver.
- This system ensures that the vehicle can only operate when the rider is wearing the helmet.
